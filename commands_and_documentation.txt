1. pip install pipenv //only for first time to install pipenv

2. pipenv shell //create a virtual environment

3. pipenv install django djangorestframework django-rest-knox // to install django not globally but only only for this project. django-rest-knox for token authentication

4. django-admin startproject leadmanager // to create project named pollster

5. manage.py is the CLI for django. Using this we can create migrations,run server

6. cd leadmanager

7. ctrl+shift+p  and type python and select with your folder's name pipenv

8. python manage.py startapp leads

9. When you create a new app, make sure add it in settings.py in INSTALLED_APPS = []. for our we add leads.rest_framework

10. Now we will create our model in leads folder models.py . Model is nothing but structure of our table i.e column_name,column_type

11. Migrations are Django's way of propagating changes you make to your models (adding a field, deleting a model, etc.) into your database schema

12. python manage.py makemigrations leads // leads's models.py can have more than one class

    // this will also create migrations folder with 0001_inital.py 
    // If we add/ delete any column in our models.py we need to again run this command and this will change 0001_inital.py (may be name)


13. python manage.py migrate // to migrate/create our app's table

14. In our leads folder create a file called serializers.py and edit this file

// also read https://www.django-rest-framework.org/api-guide/serializers/ where we make copy UserSerializer with meta class

15. Now we actually create our api

16. In our leads folder create a file called api.py and edit this file

17. Django REST framework allows you to combine the logic for a set of related views in a single class, called a ViewSet. In other frameworks you may also find conceptually similar implementations named something like 'Resources' or 'Controllers'.
